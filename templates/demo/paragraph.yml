# We demonstrate the "context" feature, which allows appending text before or after sentences
# or before the sentence entirely. This could be paragraph-level context, a longer article or
# more information related to the annotation.

# When working with long texts, you might prefer a horizontal layout to minimize scrolling.
# The following options can be freely combined.

# display:
# - side-by-side         # shows text and editor next to each other
# - text-side-by-side    # shows source and target next to each other
# - disable-lines        # disables lines between annotations which can be distracting
