# Want to integrate a database to collect annotations? You can directly post to a firebase
# database with this configuration:

# database: 
#   type: firebase
#   project_id: [YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID]
#   url: https://[YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_URL].firebaseio.com/
#   # collection: thresh      # (default: thresh) The database to use, this must exist on the firestore
#   # document: annotation    # (default: annotation) The document to use, this must exist on the firestore
#   field: annotation_set_1   # The document field to store annotations, we recommend changing this value between data collection runs

# If you want to use database integration with a different platform, please use this flag:
